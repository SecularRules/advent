#checking if this is roughly correct, steps to setup a new project:
#
#Make new repo on github
#Make a folder in the right place, open it in vsc and make a file
#git init
#pip install uv (only needed once?)
#pip install ruff (once in the venv? every time?)
#couldnt do it without pip but you said something about that..
#git branch -m master main - to rename
#setup a .venv - last project vsc did it on its own, how to do that using uv?
#dump a copy of .gitignore in the file?
#dump a copy of ruff config in where? I don't see the folder now.
#git commit -m "msg" - to get the first commit in, making a new branch before that gave issues?
#now time to make a new branch?
